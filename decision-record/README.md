# Decision Record

Recording decisions helps you think more deeply about the decision and avoid hindsight bias once the decision is made.

> A decision journal helps you collect accurate and honest feedback on what you were thinking at the time you made the decision. This feedback helps you see when you were stupid and lucky as well as when you were smart and unlucky. Finally, you can get the feedback you need to make better decisions.<sup>1</sup>
