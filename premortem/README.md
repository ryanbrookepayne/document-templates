# Premortem

Premortems help you avoid biases in decision making by imagining what will happen if your upcoming project fails horribly.

From Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman:

> What the premortem does, which I think is beautiful, is it legitimizes dissent. Actually it turns things around. It rewards people for being imaginative in finding flaws in the current plan.
