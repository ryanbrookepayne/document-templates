## [Technology Proposal](./technology-proposal.txt)

## [Decision Record](decision-record.txt)

Recording decisions helps you think more deeply about the decision and avoid hindsight bias once the decision is made.

> A decision journal helps you collect accurate and honest feedback on what you were thinking at the time you made the decision. This feedback helps you see when you were stupid and lucky as well as when you were smart and unlucky. Finally, you can get the feedback you need to make better decisions.

## Premortem

Premortems help you avoid biases in decision making by imagining what will happen if your upcoming project fails horribly.

From Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman:

> What the premortem does, which I think is beautiful, is it legitimizes dissent. Actually it turns things around. It rewards people for being imaginative in finding flaws in the current plan.
