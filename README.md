### How-to Guide

I have not created a template yet but the following examples should provide a good starting point:

- [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- [DigitalOcean's Technical Writing Guidelines - Structure](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines#structure)

### Premortem

Premortems help you avoid biases in decision making by imagining what will happen if your upcoming project fails horribly.

From Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman:

> What the premortem does, which I think is beautiful, is it legitimizes dissent. Actually it turns things around. It rewards people for being imaginative in finding flaws in the current plan.

I have not created a template yet but these resources should be a helpful starting point:

- [Pinkcast 1.6: How to anticipate (and prevent) big mistakes](https://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/pinkcast-1-6-how-to-anticipate-and-prevent-big-mistakes/)
- [Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman - Premortem to eliminate thinking biases.](https://youtu.be/MzTNMalfyhM)
- [Performing a Project Premortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem)

### User Manual

A personal user manual helps you and your colleagues understand you better by communicating how you function and work best.

Examples:

- [Sid Sijbrandij, Founder and CEO of GitLab](https://slab.com/library/gitlab-ceo-manual)
- [Abby Falik, CEO of Global Citizen Year](https://slab.com/library/global-citizen-year-manual)
